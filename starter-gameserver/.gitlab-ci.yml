# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - deploy

build-job:       # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - mvn clean install -s ci_settings.xml
    - echo "Compile complete."

deploy-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: deploy    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Deploying..."
    - mvn clean deploy -s ci_settings.xml
    - echo "Deployment complete"
